excellent machine with unacceptable screen,2.0,"About Me/ExpectationsI purchased this chromebook after having a wonderful experience with the Samsung Chromebook 3. I was very excited about the prospect of an updated version of the chromebook and when I saw that it had 6 GB of ram—I had high hopes of this being the perfect compromise between its shortcomings (aesthetics and screen size) to gain the advantages that I wanted (speed and weight). I am a college professor who uses the chromebook as a secondary machine to browse the web, manage emails, and watch videos on Youtube. While I do these things I also use a small combination of android productivity apps, either Pandora or Spotify playing in the background, and 8-12 tabs open at once. In the spectrum of chrome users, I believe I am representative of the basic or moderate level consumer. I am familiar with the operating system and have fair expectations of what a chromebook can and can’t do, but I am not a power user and do not push the system with external monitors, complicated apps, or use linux.Pros1. Speed: This chromebook utilizes the Celeron N4000 processor and 6 gb of ram. I really think that anyone who hasn’t had a chromebook or hasn’t updated in a while will be happy if they find a machine that uses the N4000 processor. Although it is only a dual-core Celeron processor that doesn’t wow you with its base speed, it has a 4 mb cache. Most of the processors in budget machines in the past generations had 1-2 mb caches at most. This change is one that you actually feel when using the chromebook because this will increase the pace of things I believe most users like such as: switching between tabs, quickly loading pages, and multitasking. The 6 gb of ram is a unique selling point and a really excellent choice by Samsung. Chromebooks usually come in two ram options 4 gb vs. 8 gb with the 8 gb units typically much rarer and unavailable as an upgrade on many units. While they run perfectly well on 4 gb, the 6 gb is a comfortable upgrade. It is impossible for me to isolate how much of the buttery smooth speed of the machine is due to the processor or due to the extra 2 gb of ram from the norm, but the combination makes for a wonderful user experience.2. Size: The weight of the machine and the form factor are very satisfying. This device adds very little weight to your bag while traveling and for walks across campus, that lighter frame is much appreciated. I enjoy the fact that despite being so light that it does not feel overly cheap; it’s far sturdier than one would expect for a cheap and light device. Overall, for anyone who enjoys the lightweight portability provided by an 11.6 inch machine—this one fits the bill while feeling substantial enough that it avoids feeling flimsy.Con:Screen: This is the first time that I can say that on a machine that I otherwise enjoyed that there was a single feature that could be a deal-breaker, but the screen is genuinely that bad. It isn’t because of the resolution because most chromebooks, especially in the budget range and at 11.6 inch screen size, all have the same resolution. It also isn’t because it is a TN panel because the Samsung Chromebook 3 had a manageable TN panel that didn’t break its usability. This panel is just wretched. It has ridiculously specific viewing angles. If you don’t hit it spot on with your eyes then colors wash out and text gets blurry at the top or bottom of the screen. It’s so grainy, washed out, and pixelated that it unfits the device for almost all of my primary needs. The brightness even seems less than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I am just flabbergasted that they selected such a bad panel that feels like a step back from their best-selling previous model. The screen was literally so bad I wondered if I had a defective model, but my experience seems consistent with the limited reviews available for this machine.ConclusionThis machine was one that I wanted to love and everything that I saw on paper that I believed I would like—I did. The speed is there and the 6 gb of ram cannot be undersold as an excellent choice by Samsung, so I was happy about that. The keyboard was serviceable, which I expected and would have been satisfied with if it hadn’t been for the screen. The screen is just unacceptable at any price point. The speed and smooth operation cannot offset the quality of the panel being used here. You look at the screen for everything you do unless you are using an external monitor and this one is almost guaranteed to give you eyestrain and become an irritating chore to constantly rework the angle of your eyes to the screen and the angle of the screen on the hinge. In my opinion it just isn’t worth it. This might sound like I am overly critical or I am knocking the machine too much for one issue, but an otherwise spectacular experience can, indeed, be ruined if one of the key components used is as bad as this screen. Showroom this model against alternative 11.6 inch chromebooks and you will see what I mean. Don’t select nicer models, IPS screens, or more expensive models; put it side-by-side with other budget TN options and you will see that at the same resolution and same size that the numbers lie and this screen is simply worse than the alternatives. Despite my desire to love it and the excellent choices made my Samsung for the processor and ram combo, the screen panel choice outweighs those good choices and destroys the quality of the final product."
Poor screen quality,2.0,I bought the 6 GB ram model directly from Samsung.  If the screen was better this would be five stars.  Good build quality and the little details seemed to be well done.  The screen though makes this useless.  The screen is highly directional.  Slight movement causes the screen to changebrightnesss level to such a degree that it results in eye strain.  This happened with just the slight movement from resting it on my lap and trying to work on it.  Even when viewed from the best angle the text appears fuzzy and shadowed.  The screen quality is unfortunate since this would be a fantastic unit otherwise.
Product good - service not so much,4.0,"This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!"
Love this thing,5.0,"Listen, this is a sub $300 Chromebook— they had to cut costs somewhere. Is the TN panel great? No. But this laptop cost me $302 with tax, has 6gb of RAM and 64gb of storage, will be updated at least until 2026,  also does what I need it to do (homework/writing). I have the Samsung Chrome book 3 too, and the 4 is a nice upgrade. This is a light laptop with a small footprint. so I can easily carry it back and forth to campus. Also, the new design is freaking sexy. Probably my favorite laptop of all time."
Great Chromebook,4.0,"This is a great Chromebook with good keyboard, touchpad, and great battery life. The display is not as good as those laptops costing 2 to 4 times as much but it is fine for daily use and I don't find it be a problem even when using it for long periods of time."
Great Internet machine,4.0,"I ordered this for my wife. It is perfect for her to surf the Internet and check email quickly. As others have said, the screen could be better. The screen is not good when viewed at from an angle. But then, it's an inexpensive item. It's the first Chromebook I've ever purchased. The speed is great. It boots almost instantly. It has great battery life. It is very light. The keyboard is responsive. It has to USB 3.0 ports and bluetooth. I connected an inexpensive bluetooth mouse to the system without a problem. My wife could not be happier."
Poor quality,3.0,Pixels went out after less than 6 months.
Very unhappy and disappointed.,1.0,This product worked the first day for 15 min.  We charged it over night.  It now turns on for 1 sec. and then turns off immediately!  I am so upset.  This was a gift for my son so that he could do schoolwork on it.  What a waste of money.  I am trying to return it and there is no way to do it
Excellent laptop for under $300,5.0,"I am writing this based on the fact that this cost $234.  I see many reviews here complaining about the screen.  Remember what you have purchased.  This laptop is fast, light and well made.  There is even a good amount of storage for a personal computer.  Yes, the screen is not as vivid as a $1000 computer, if that is very important to you, buy a more expensive laptop.  For those who need to use email, browse the web, stream etc. you can not go wrong with this.  There is one USB port and one USB C port.  There are inexpensive attachments if you need hdmi or more ports.  I highly recommend this chromebook."
Great Product!,3.0,"I was absolutely delighted when I received this product. I originally bought it to replace my lenovo laptop that I mistakenly broke. I am a college student, so I wanted a product that could handle loading files and was light weight, making it easier to carry around campus. It came in a day early, and was much tinier then expected, which I am delighted about. Its super lightweight and seems to be running everything just fine. I will update if anything happens.***UPDATE***Okay, so at first I gave this chromebook a 5/5 star rating. However, after a few weeks of using it I have discovered some quirks about the chromebook that I find to be rather irritating as I am a creature of habit. The first one being, there is NO delete button. I don't think this would be a deal breaker at first, but it is slightly annoying. The second one being, whenever I want to write an email, I can't press ""tab"" to indent anymore.  In fact, it seems like I can't do it in any box that I can put text in, such as the box for this review. The third thing, being that you can NOT right click without pressing the ""alt"" tab. Last but not least, there is no way to add apps to the background of this device. The shortcuts are the only way to have apps available. While I understand this isn't necessarily a laptop and that features guaranteed to be different, all four of these issues combined has caused enough irritation for me to write this review. Don't get me wrong, this laptop is great for school. The web camera is wonderful, I don't have any connection issues, but these weird perks are very annoying. Had I known that the chromebooks were designed like that, it would have eased my frustrations getting use to this, or I would have considered getting something else."
"If poor saturation matters, consider Grayscale",5.0,"You will get what you pay for, but not in my case as long as performance & battery life concerned. If it comes with an IPS or OLED instead of a low-end TN screen, it wouldn't be an affordable one.A TN LCD panel has a narrow viewing angle, however, it features a much faster response time than the IPS counterpart, so a gamer's choice nowadays. FYI, WebGL Aquarium test scores amazing 60 fps with 500 fishes running on this Chromebook.The poor saturation is not so terrible but barely acceptable. If that matters, a less distracting grayscale over an addictive color display would be desirable. Unfortunately, a google system-wide grayscale option is not available yet, but as a workaround, a chrome web browser addon like ""Grayscale the Web"" does a great job.I appreciate they have tried to meet the least common multiple requirements with minimalism in mind."
Malfunctioning key board and inept Samsung Technical Support,1.0,"I am a long time Samsung customer.  All of my family cellphones and chromebooks are Samsung.  I usually have good luck with them. My older Samsung chromebooks were a dream to use so I thought by purchasing this - it would be the same.  but right after the month I purchased from Amazon - the keyboard malfunctioned. When I type letters, I would get other letters with it.  My numbers on my keyboard no longer worked which made it difficult for me to type in my very strong password. I had to go and use the virtual keyboard to log in. I have spent 4 hours with Samsung technical service - 1 hour of waiting on the telephone that did not count with the texting support. One technical support agent said I need to get it fixed since it appeared to be a hardware issue - but Samsung website directed me to another technical support agent when I informed it I wanted to get it fixed. Same old instructions of reset and Chrome OS updates - to no avail.  I would return this but Amazon does not accept this since this is after 30 days of purchase (it is day 40) so I will have to either find a person to fix this or buy a new one."
Good little laptop.,5.0,"People are complaining about the screen, so I expected it to be so much worse than it actually is. For a laptop at this price point the screen is more than satisfactory. Easy to setup and use. My six year old twins are doing great on the two I purchased."
Not Recomended,1.0,"Everything good with the product the first month. I bought it on August 6 2020. Then it just not working on Oct 6, 2020 It went off working with it and does not turn on. The battery was full. I purchased th asurion insurance for 45.99 that says its all covered for 2 years and they say I have to use the manufacturer guarantee. Here in PR there is no samsung store that gives service to chromebooks. Only 2 months of use and its not working. Waste of money. I called customer service ""amazon"" and they can't offer a resolution for this, only to call the asurion plan. Real bad experience. NOT RECOMMENDED."
"Alt key defect, bad quality management!",3.0,"My alt key is oblique ,it mean left side is higher than righ side, just alt key , do I need upload photo? Maybe it can help you understand the defect  ，“Alt key is oblique,left side is higher! your Quality management is bad!”Btw ,chrome os can’t install some apk data ,not like normal Android os, it need additional step(turn on chrome os developer mode to install apps from sources other than the play store)"
Great for kids and distance learning,5.0,"I have a ten year old In 4th who is using this for distance learning this year.  This is our family’s first experience with a Chromebook and we think it’s great.  It’s a great value for the money and perfect for an elementary school student who just needs basic internet, zoom, etc.  I was worried about screen quality after reading the reviews but it’s totally fine - don’t expect the quality of an ipad, smartphone, or tv, but it is far from terrible.  I’ve sat next to him during lessons and it’s fine from my diagonal view as well."
The best budget Chromebook on the market!!,5.0,"This Chromebook is lightening fast ... very responsive with no lag. I've had 30+ tabs open with no loss of performance. Others have mentioned the screen was an issue for them but I think the display is fantastic. I typically don't need to adjust the viewing angle unless I'm constantly moving around, but that's a user issue not a hardware one. I can't recommend this Chromebook highly enough! Go on ahead and buy it. You'll be glad you did."
Good buy,5.0,"I was really happy upon receiving this. I was not very computer friendly, and this is stupid easy to navigate. I am going to college after being out of high school 22 years, and this is making it really easy for me. Everything is in my chromebook and easy to access. It came well packaged, brand new, no problems. The only thing that bugs me is there is no numerical pad on the side like on desktop, but considering its size, I get it. The screen also could be clearer. I definitely wouldn't recommend rhis for shopping online, but for schoolwork that I need to get done, it's fantastic."
Great deal!,5.0,We had to get 2 of these for our girls starting backvto school. They only gave us 2 weeks notice before school that they would need a chromebook. They even arrived 4 days before they were expected. They were brand new and easy to setup.
ordered 3 - 2 worked and the one shut down after a couple hours,3.0,we ordered 3 for grandchildren to do schoolwork as the chromebooks were what they used at school.  the three came early.  after we delivered them they started catching up on schoolwork immediately but one shut down after a couple of hours and acted like it had a short - the screen would come back on but the keyboard would not work.we tried to call customer service but no answer and the chatline said to try to repair it ourselves. in the end we returned the laptop because the replace button was not available and were charged almost $100.00 more to replace it. That was 2 days ago and still not shipped! So disappointed but times are bad right now - just need the computer for schoolwork and have always depended on Amazon before! these were not refurbished and we expected more than 2 hours or at least some customer service
Easy to use for your basic tasks,5.0,I need a basic computer for writing papers and going online. It needed to do nothing fancy so this works great. I am majorily computer illeterate and had no issues navigating this. It holds a good charge too.
Amazing,5.0,"I've used Chromebooks for years and have tried many brands. Samsung is the best, hands down.Some of my favorite features are long battery life, fast charging, no fan (it doesn't get super hot), ease of use, and simplicity. You can log on to a new one with your Gmail credentials and voila, you're up and running, just as before.This new version offers some great improvements.- Better performance. No lag during Zoom calls if you're on a decent connection, for example.- Type C charger you can share with other devices like Android smartphones- More solid shell and materials overallThe camera has not improved and I think my old one has a tiny advantage here. My Zoom setup looks brighter on my previous Chromebook for example.Overall, I love this Chromebook. I have a full laptop with a Linux build to do things that aren't suited for Chromebook but this is an excellent, lightweight solution for most of what I do for work.  High recommend."
Great Chromebook for the less discerning,5.0,"I needed a new Chromebook, but I specifically did not want the convertible kind with a touchscreen, and I did not want to pay more for features I actively did not want.  I also wanted one with an 11"" screen that had more memory and ram than the cheapest models.  This was pretty much the only Chromebook that fit those criteria.  I saw that most everyone liked it except for the screen, and I figured I had low enough demands for screen performance that it was worth a try.  I got a great deal on the 6/64 version, and I love it.  It's fast, lightweight, good keyboard, and the screen is fine for my philistine level of pixel appreciation.  If you like to watch movies etc. on your Chromebook I'd suggest taking into account the warnings from the other fine reviewers here, but if you just want to read, write, browse, and watch YouTube videos, you'll probably be satisfied."
The Oregon Trail of Screens,2.0,"Have you ever thought to yourself ""Man, I wish I could go back to Windows 97 and my giant desktop computer with it's impossibly dull screen""? Oh... no? OK, then you don't want this computer. I was actually shocked when I turned it on. Even Kindle Paperwhite's have a brighter screen. Mine also had a pixel out which was the icing on the cake. It's decent speed, but honestly I'd rather use a tablet than have this. Unless you are using it because you absolutely have to have a computer and you're straining your eyes to type a paper, look elsewhere. I bought it on Prime Day and trusted the quality of Samsung but I was let down."
Power charger is the HDMI out-put as well.,4.0,"A good little machine.  If you just want to use it to surf the internet and that sort of thing, can't beat the price.  I knew the screen wasn't going to be the best before i bought it, and in fairness the images are a little flat, but again I just use it as an internet surfer platform.  HOWEVER,..., what i wish I did know before i bought it, and would have been a reason why i WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT is the ports available.  It DOES NOT have an HDMI port, only the mini port which is how you charge it.  So i would also use my Chrome book to watch streaming on my TV, connecting it to my larger TV, to do so i had to buy an adapter to plug in a full size HDMI into the mini, but in doing so you CANNOT charge it, so if you are watching a movie, or anything you have to run off battery power, it will always have enough to get you through a movie, but the stress of watching the batter life slowly march down to zero really plays on my anxiety.  Further there is only one USB port, so if you have a cordless mouse plugged in you can't plug in any other USB, example, if you want to download from your phone you have to unplug the cordless mouse, which drives me nuts.  But do note that it has bluetooth capabilities so you can always get a blue tooth mouse to solve that problem, I'm just not tech savy enough to pull that off.  in the end the lack of a full size HDMI AND also a charger would make me buy a different machine, but i already have it, and i make it work, stress and all when running it off battery at my work station or TV.  Just something i wish i had looked into more before i bought it.  Hope that helps.  Also there isn't a 'Delete' button, why ?"
I’m done,1.0,"I don’t know if I received this broken or what, but I took it out of the box and set it up for my husband and it wouldn’t turn on, or do anything. So that was $200 down the drain. Now it’s a play computer for my year old son...."
Screen is absolute garbage,1.0,"I got two of these for the kids to use. The screens are absolutely horrible. Also NOT touchscreen despite misleading description. They make them borderline unusable. I also ordered acer Chromebook R11 and an acer spin 311. Both screens are so much better at basically the same price point, with similar build quality and features.DO NOT BUY THIS."
"Excellent. Very Authentic Craftsmanship. Shout-out to Samsung and Chrome Developer s, Manufacturer s",5.0,"Excellent. Very Authentic Craftsmanship.Shout-out to Samsung and Chrome Developer s, Manufacturer s, etc., Teams that were involved making this fluid Invention from out of our Lovely element's within our Earthly Creation.I'm taking my BA in Information Technology concentration Software Development & Analysis... and this is a great Beast of a Machine.🎯👁️🗝️⚡💯🤑👀"
Don't waste your money,1.0,"I have bought a lot of Samsung products in my 61 years. I have never had a minute's trouble with any of them until I bought this Samsung Chromebook. I am extremely dissatisfied with it. The cursor freezes up when I go to click on the time to get to settings. To be able to see the screen, I have to use the arrows to move back and forth across the screen. It is a small screen but still you should be able to see all of it after setting the resolution. I set the resolution but it won't stay. I am constantly having to reset it. To me, it is a waste of money. I so wish I had gotten the Windows Operating system. I do not recommend this product. Sadly, it is past the 30 days, and can't be returned."
Seemed worth the money but major hidden costs,1.0,"Fourth Update:A brief moment of connectivity assured me: ""You're connected to a Ethernet network."" Not just getting norked out of your two hundred smackers and your valuable time. Right? Not just serving to provide a connection to someone who lacks a valid visa, Right? Now's the time to dish the real dirt on the first purchase: it burned my legs, there was some bad circuitry or programming. This device is labeled as made in VietNam but I wouldn't be sure it's even that good. The price is cheap and the build is like from Mattel but this is no toy. Buyer Beware!!!The replacement seemed new enough & didn't burn my legs or fingers but I had to return it. Along with the bargain chromebook came some dedicated representatives of the seller/manufacturer...? Who set up camp across the creek from my cabin & have been diggling with the connections for weeks. Its been a total hassle. Still I wanted to avoid the bother of returning a $200 dollar purchase & tried & tried to make it work but just like the first purchased (killswitched) there has been an administrative kaibosh on internet access at the last day to return the thing. I was one hundred percent connected yet denied internet access (see screenshot) & had to use my older chromebook to set up the return.Updates: (third review)The replacement netbook from Samsung. Could Amazon be the unwitting host of a seller of stolen or even counterfeit goods? More and more programming irregularities keep  showing up. Like the pic I'm posting now: Prompted to use Guest Mode and/or Sign In when I already AM in Guest Mode...Still I really wanted to love the netbook but closer inspection showed more and more signs of excessive factory-programmed presets and physical scuff marks, even dings in the cover that evidenced this was a used chromebook. I would still give it four stars for the moments it did work, at one point my one-bar cell connection ran an hour-long documentary on Prime Video with virtually no interruptions, BUT once I attempted to use the logged-in owner account and install ZOOM and Bitdefender the thing just DIED!!! It won't charge, it won't turn on, NOTHING!!!Thank God I'm within the 30-day return period and bought the Assurion plan, but how disappointing to have to return it, it looks like if this sort of problem continues I might be profiled as a difficult customer.The main reason I selected this 6GB RAM Samsung Chromebook: the USB charging function, and for this I'd give it ten stars if possible.Drawbacks: The hi-speed charger that came with the unit just about overheated & I had to purchase the 45w adapter and a couple C-to-USB adapters separately, but my dream of keeping my off-grid connection charged from my rinkydink solar setup has now come true!Bonus Tips from a Non-techie: I'm not a techie here so I'm just wondering if the compatability between my Samsung phone and chromebook has boosted the connectivity through the use of tethering plus bluetooth. Whether it's the faster processor or whatnot, what took hours to load a 3-minute video before now loads instantly and this has saved me the time and expense of buying a signal booster.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K8G7663/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QMSZR2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
EXCELENTE PARA ESTUDIANTES Y NIÑOS,5.0,"Excelente para estudiantes, conectividad a internet wifi súper rápido, permite instalar office, zoom y full aplicaciones del play store. Tambien instale para mi hija netflix e iptv y corrieron super bien. Algo que me encantó fue el sonido realmente espectacular. Otra funcion super practica es la transmitir al chromecast la pantalla y sonido inalámbricamente. Super liviana y bonita (parece Mac 😅). Para trabajo no la recomiendo ya que las apps de office no son las completas; por ejemplo tablas dinámicas no hay la opción en excel."
Very handy and portable; not perfect,4.0,"Pros...I travel quite a lot and was looking for a simple, lightweight chromebook to check email, browse the internet and watch movies on, on the go. This works GREAT for that and I like that the battery life is good enough that I don't need to bring my cord on a one-day trip.The cons..... As others has mentioned, if you are not at the right angle, the screen will be black while you are watching something. That's easy to remedy when sitting, watching a movie alone; but it was very annoying while doing a fitness class via Zoom or watching something with another person. Also Zoom related, I found the camera to be pretty poor, especially in lower light. Final con is that it keeps giving me a message that I have ejected the SD card when I have not."
Worst of Everything,2.0,This is a phone disguised as a laptop and it can't even do what a phone can do. You cannot download and install any software. Not even office programs. It allows you to use Google docs but not very well. I feel like I've been beaten back before the '80s. Like I think word perfect did a better job. It only allows you to download phone apps which aren't super compatible on a laptop. This thing is a wreck and a mess. I usually love Google products. I have a Google Pixel phone. I have Gmail. I like these things. But Chromebooks are garbage. Save yourself the hassle and buy a laptop. You don't need a laptop pretending to be a phone that can't do half the things of phone can do and none of the things a laptop can do. You'd be better off buying a keyboard and attaching it to your phone. Horrible product.
"After only 2 months, it won't charge.",3.0,I absolutely love my new Chromebook but I'm very frustrated with the battery issues. The battery suddenly refuses to charge and I've done every step to troubleshoot and correct the problem.  Even my IT guy can't get it to cooperate.  I expected better from Samsung as my tablets and other products work just fine.
Satisfied Owner,4.0,"I got this for my daughter. She was used to the Asus 12.5"" chromebook with backlit keyboard and touch screen but has had no real complaints about this one.It is comfortable and light enough that she moves around with it easily.It has been working well since she got it for Christmas, 2020. It is being used for online classes so it gets the job done."
The screen on this Chromebook is useless.,1.0,"I was looking for something sample, the size is perfect and it looks good but the screen is useless on this one."
Power cord died in less than two months.,2.0,"Power cord died in less than two months.  I haven't been able to use the chromebook much because I have been working a lot, so there is absolutely no reason the cord should have died already.  I refuse to give it a higher review because this is ridiculous and I believe speaks volumes for the poor quality this company is fine with producing and selling."
Perfect,5.0,"I wasn't actually sure what to expect but I'm seriously happy with this little Samsung Chromebook. My Toshiba Satellite finally gave up the ghost after 8 years of Windows updates and I decided to go with something smaller, cheaper, simpler and lighter. This Chromebook is perfect for me. If you want a screen that is seriously crisp, don't choose this one. The screen is small and sometimes causes eye strain, although with the light turned lower my eyes can last for hours. I love the weight and size of this laptop. It's perfect for my online genealogy work and for emails and reading the news. Thanks. I highly recommend for anyone who doesn't need high resolution or a disk for gaming or graphics work."
functional chromebook,4.0,"a chromebook is a chromebook, somewhat. that said, what will stand out is the negatives: the screen is not the best...it's a little dull. the speakers are not the best...they're a little soft. but, the big problem was the price: i guess there was a big demand for chromebooks during lockdown, so the shysters raised the price on me. i bought it anyway. it was more than twice as much as my old ACER chromebook. all that said i'd probably get it again but look for a better deal. whatever....it's all going to get swallowed by the sun anyway \m/"
Chrome 4 Notebook real review,4.0,I am used to windows. I have always worked with android vs apple and found it difficult to upload all my desired apps. I had problems with OS reading my page while streaming Netflix and Prime. Message error every 20 minutes. It's a very basic notebook with only 1 port. Ok for young students.
Functional for my kindergartner,3.0,"The screen and camera are poor but it is a functional piece for a student, young student"
Better than expected,5.0,"I owned a chromebook before and changed to a Windows 10 which caused so many problems with bluetooth and droped utilities and the latest problem with the screen  background changing to white I gave up and decided to try chromebook agai.. The program works better than expected, bluetooth works without ag,itch my wireless mouse and headphones connected right ge the  computer away. The widows computer was a constant headache,. The only drawback is the ac adapter requires me to use the provided adapter to computer. It is unclear if I can use a USB plug to charge the battery as neither a USB-C nor an android plug fits the computer."
Very happy with it.,4.0,For the money I don't think you can beat it. I saw where folks were recommending getting 6gb ram and I'm glad I did.Pro's:  Great little Chromebook.  Quick.Con's:  Display could be better.
I like it just fine for what I'm using it for but it is small,5.0,"So far so good! Firstly we completely charge things before we use them for the first time. To all who will buy this, it is on the small side and thin but it's nice. I do wish it was packaged better for shipping, it literally came in the box it's sold in with very little support from getting jarred around in that box. I do know the carriers aren't always careful with packages so better packaging and more support would be a good thing before shipping so that the computer doesn't get jarred and banged up during the shipping process. There is nothing wrong with the computer at all and it works great but in my opinion would be great for younger people because of how small it is. For what I'm using it for it's perfect but if you're wanting a bigger screen so you can see things better and bigger this one isn't for you.  All in all so far so good tho I like it"
Good for Basic Use,4.0,"This is a decent computer for basic use like email and internet. The screen quality isn't the best. It's a bit dull. When I received this computer, I was surprised at how small it is. But it works for the kind of things I plan on doing with it."
"Poor Screen Quality, Lacks Normal Features",3.0,"Good RAM and performance.  The screen is worse than many 10+ year old laptops, doesn't seem to be HD or just barely.  Missing common features such as a touch screen or a backlit keyboard.  Wouldn't buy again."
We got two,5.0,"My husband bought me one for my birthday and we both liked it so much he just bought himself one. If you need a simple, cheap computer to work on with a long battery life, this is a great computer for that! I have mine on all the time and the battery lasts all day and even into the next. If you know android well, the computer works like that so you know it is simple and very customizable"
"Cheap., but.... Cheap",2.0,"The good...  It was cheap and I wanted a Chromebook to read emails and watch movies and tv shows.The screen is horrible quality.  You can only watch it if you are seeing it at the right angle, and even then it's is very bad (especially with dark colors).The sound is so tinny you can barely hear it without headphones.If you are considering this product, consider again and look for an alternative that has a better screen.  This one is virtually useless.One of the questions Amazon is asks is about the touch screen --  THIS IS NOT TOUCH SCREEN."
Waste of money,1.0,"I bought this Chromebook in June 2020 as a Christmas gift. Since 12/25 it's been used carefully & taken excellent care of. Recently, for no reason, in the middle of a Zoom call or some other activity, the screen goes black, it shuts off, and will not turn back on again for hours or days, even though it's fully charged. Support for the product ended in July, one month after purchase!! My suggestion? Whatever you buy, don't buy this!!!"
Great Little Chromebook but Be Aware of Limitations,3.0,"I'll start with the Cons:Cons: If you have a community internet system at an apartment or condo that requires a password to access the system, you will not be able to get online without jumping through a lot of hoops.  You will need to use another device (smart phone or Windows device) to get the information that explains how to do so, and it is complicated.  Buying a Chromebook is  for the purpose of simplicity and you won't be able to configure your Chromebook until you get past that hurdle.  The other con is that you cannot download the latest version of the Alexa app because it is not compatible with this unit.  If your purpose is to control/configure your smart home or other Alexa connected devices, you can't do it with this particular Chromebook.  If you want to get a Windows based laptop in the same price range, it will be in ""S"" mode, which is great; however, you will need to turn off ""S"" mode to get anything from an app store that is NOT Microsoft and can only use the Edge browser, again, by turning off S mode.  There is a simple way to remove ""S"" mode (which is for security) but once you take it off, you can never put it back on. so be aware.Pros: This is a fine looking, easy to use Chromebook that works as a Chromebook should - fast and easy to understand as long as you don't have the above listed situation.  It does not have a touch screen and the screen resolution is okay for the price point.  If you need this for a home schooled student or for just a quick way to browse the internet and make online purchases, this item is worth the money.  I'm disappointed that it didn't work out for me but in some situations, it will be just fine.  I tested the Chromebook on both a community internet system and a private residential system."
value laptop,4.0,It does the job for basic needs. Great computer for kids and teens. Amazon actually had the best price for this laptop
Good Overall - Low Quality Screen,4.0,"I use mine for writing manuscripts so I don't demand a lot of it. works fine, best feature is the battery life, I can write for 3-4 days without having to charge it. speakers aren't bad either. The only significant negative thing I can think of is the screen resolution, looks very very cheap and low quality, looks like a cheap portable DVD player screen from the early 2000's."
The screen...is really bad!,3.0,"Got the 6GB version. The screen stood out as VERY directional and looks washed out if you're at any angle that's not perfectly perpendicular to the screen.  If you have a Kindle fire HD, this screen will be a downgrade.  Was going to use this for digital learning but didn't want to risk destroying the kiddo's vision with this terrible screen.  Had to send it back."
It does the job!!,5.0,I love this laptop! It does its job. I just wanted a laptop for emails and to take my classes online and something not so expensive & this is it !! Great price and good quality. Battery life is excellent. And it came in good condition.
Only in a pinch,2.0,Dim screen.  It's cheap but you can do better.
Not bad for the price,3.0,Its slim and light weight. I like everything about it but the graphics. The clarity is terrible
"not worth the money, save an additional 100 dollars and just buy a laptop.",1.0,"not worth it, trying to connect a printer to a Chromebook is almost impossible even with printer id number, then you need router Id, then cable id, what a nightmare. for an extra 100 dollars you can get a decent laptop these days that is better than a 249 dollar Chromebook.  if this was 100 dollars I would say it's worth it, but save your money an extra 100 dollars and just buy a laptop. or better yet for about 120 dollars buy a decent galaxy Samsung tablet."
Unit works well but does not include an HDMI port.,4.0,"This is my second Chromebook.  I liked my first one so much, I bought a second built by a different manufacturer.  My first CB included an HDMI port which I use/d for an external monitor and/or TV  hook up. Thinking all Chromebooks had these ports, I was surprised when this arrived without one.  It's no big deal for me but if an HDMI port is a necessity this machine isn't for you.  Otherwise, I am very pleased."
"Good, except for the screen. Screen is garbage.",4.0,"Decent entry-level Chromebook. The keyboard is decent and the processor and RAM make it quick. The body is sturdy and could probably survive a drop. However, the screen is probably on of the worst screens I have ever used."
Basic and Reliable,4.0,"I purchased this for a friend that did not have a computer.  Since I had to assist with set up over the phone, a Chromebook is the easiest set up and easy for the user, so it was the best choice in this instance.  This model is bare bones - no touch screen, no backlighted keyboard.  The specs covered what I wanted it to do and the results have been great.  Worth the $$$"
Was supposed to be new,1.0,"I purposely bought a NEW device for my son after having issues with “refurbished” devices in the past and he had issues within the first 30 days.. I let the vendor know ASAP and was told that he would get a replacement… WELL, that didn’t happen and I’m afraid that I may be stuck with a defective device..I would NOT recommend purchasing anything from this vendor!"
Very good,5.0,"I have never had a chrome book but since it’s made by Samsung it’s awesome because all my devices in my house is a Samsung, and before I always use Microsoft but this laptop is awesome I like it the screen is bright Very easy to work with the mouse is very loose and easy to navigate. It’s not a touchscreen but I still know how to use the arrow up an arrow down or you can go to the right side and scroll while pressing down the left click and scroll down. Plus the battery life is very good I charged it when I received it and it’s been a week and it’s still full."
Easy to travel with,4.0,"I just needed something I could use to do research as I write where ever I go. It is easy to travel with. It's not the best screen resolution, but I only use it for writing so I'm not complaining. It's not touch screen which I knew before buying. Battery life is pretty great. I write and have multiple screens up online for hours and the battery is barely affected. I only chose this chromebook because I have a lot of other Samsung devices and they easily connect together. As far as everything else the laptop can offer I have no clue. But if you are looking for the bare minimum, I would recommend."
I love chrome book! I couldn’t see myself using another computer!,5.0,"I loved everything about the chrome book from how easy & fast the setup was to how user friendly it has been since. I bought it for a podcast I plan on starting soon & it’s been awesome so far. This computer can handle anything you can possibly throw at it. I have my recording software downloaded straight from google play & I’ve been doing all my research on it as well as watching Disney+ on it. I wish the speakers were a little louder, but aside from that this is the best computer I’ve ever owned & you’d never know it was used!"
Not bad value.,4.0,"In a way, it almost feels like a retro laptop. The screen is kinda lousy, and it certainly isn't HD. But that gives it an old school laptop feel. Reminds me of the computer I used in grad school. For the money, it is hard to beat. Very hard. But, if you're going to watch a lot of movies, I would not recommend it."
Does not have two usb ports has 1 c 1 usb,3.0,Lack of a caps button have to use shift key this is harder for children online. Only has one port usb regular. Has one c port for charger.
"Great, light machine in its price range",5.0,"Although the screen is nothing to write home about, the machine is well-built, has a sturdy feel, and is very lightweight. With 6GB of RAM everything works quickly and smoothly, and you could have more than a dozen tabs open without a slowdown. The machine will also get automatic security OS updates from Google until June of 2026. Overall, I would highly recommend this Chromebook."
Broke within a month,2.0,"It worked fine for a month, then my cat on the keyboard and it died. I'm sure I'm not supposed to let her do that, but cats will be cats. I learned my lesson and will go back to a traditional laptop that can handle my cat's adoration."
Love It‼,5.0,"I must admit when originally purchased last year, I rant the Chromebook was too small. Since, I use more and more, pleased. Just needed to give it a try, now use more often❤"
Nice feel,4.0,I really got into touch screen because most small tablets have poor feeling keys and a so so mouse pad. This tablet has a great feeling keyboard allowing easy touch tryping. The mouse pad also is nice to use so I find myself not touching the screen as often. So far I really like this tablet. Plenty of USB sockets allow use of accessories and of course the Chrome operating system keeps me secure. Latest computer allows download of Android apps.
"This is a great, affordable Chromebook",5.0,"My 13 year old son got this (a bit late, my fault, not Amazon's) for Christmas.  He LOVES it.  Perfect for him to browse the internet or play Roblox.  It's nice and light, very portable.  We opted for the 6 GB of RAM version, as I like more RAM.  Overall, happy with the purchase and it arrived in a very timely manner, even with covid!"
Great laptop!,5.0,"Great laptop for my 9 year old! He hasn’t put it down since he got it as a Christmas present loves to use it for games and also uses it for his schoolwork. The size is perfect lightweight and very durable, the graphics are just fine for a middle quality laptop it’s not the best it’s definitely not the cheapest it’s just a nice quality affordable laptop for everyday use and I will definitely recommend."
Works for remote school and netflix,5.0,"Bought two of these for kids to do remote school from -- does exactly that -- only infrequent issues that are easily solvable. Bought for 7th and 9th grader and it fulfills its mission. Also good for netflix (screen quality isn't great -- but for 9th grader, watching in her own room, that's not a concern) and general web browsing, email, etc."
Mini laptop,4.0,"So I saw the reviews for this and the laptop does everything it says its gona do the only thing that sucks is the screen quality or volume if your watching youtube music videos but it's very good if your just taking notes, and use it for work or school."
Buyer Beware,2.0,Bought 2 of these for my kids. worked great for 4 months for school. One of the two stopped charging one day. Factory reset did not work. it is not the charger as both chargers charge my other identical chromebook. Buyer beware. lasts just past the 90 day return window and then died. Wonder how long the other one would last for?
Lots of issues,1.0,Ist time user of Chromebook op system. Bought it for my wife thinking it would be easier than a Microsoft pc....no way... currently experiencing audio issues. Only works with headphones  Will possibly return ... If possible...
Do not buy. This product is defective and has a history of battery issues.,1.0,"I bought this for my son to use at school. Within 2 weeks, the battery stopped charging. I should have returned it immediately but figured it was an easy fix and took it to a repair shop. Due to supply chain issues, it took them about 2 more weeks to get a new battery. When I got it back, it worked for another day before  having the same issue again.We looked online and apparently, this is a common problem with this computer.Because I tried to have it repaired myself we'd passed the 30 day return window, so Amazon wasn't obligated to accept a return. And the seller refused to engage. Ultimately, Amazon did take it back, although they didn't have to (thank you, Amazon).So just don't buy this computer, despite all the favorable reviews online."
good value,4.0,"A fairly good travel and casual use machine for the money. Battery life is noting like the advertisement, I have not seen over six hours at best."
Great value but screen is horrible,3.0,Great value but screen is horrible
Not what advertised!,1.0,Product is not what was advertised or described. This is not a touchscreen chrome book. Overpriced for what I received. Very disappointed!
Very nice but cannot install windows on it.,4.0,This is a very nice chrome book. Unfortunately I did not know you cannot use windows with it so I returned it. On start up it prompts everything you need for start up to make it easy. After several hours of use we found that we could not install windows and wife needs windows for work. This is unfortunate because this was so fast. Would recommend if you do not need windows.
Backup laptop for teaching online support.,4.0,"Great little laptop! Functional with no frills, 6gb ram helps it along a bit. I bet it outlast my surface book by several years! (I actually love the Surface books - but didn't want to shell out that kinda money for a backup machine). As long as you have reasonable expectations it's GREAT."
"Very suitable for most internet users, no touch screen, printer and mouse concern. No file password",3.0,"Chromebook does not work with older printer, Canon MX922.Only one USB port, so mouse might occupy that.Google Docs does not have the ability to password protect files.No touch screen.Still very useful for internet, searches, email, web activity.Can download apps like Android."
Love this little ChromeBook,5.0,"I love this little laptop. It does what I need it too. it is nothing compared to my macbook Pros. But it is very good for surfing the web and playing a couple basic games. For 6 GB RAM, this is a  very affordable option. But it's still cheap enough to where it wouldn't be a huge deal if it got stolen."
Value for Money,5.0,"This is exactly what a $170 laptop should be. Tablets cannot replace desktop-capable devices for browser and file needs. This is essentially a tablet with more functionality in that regard. The commenters with complaints about the screen aren’t wrong, but did you spend $1K? $500? Even $200? No. You spent $170, and you received one of the absolute least expensive laptops out there. If you want a beautiful display, look elsewhere. This laptop does a great job for those who need more functionality than a tablet can provide, at the lowest possible price-point."
Black Screen,1.0,Black Screen after 15 minutes of use unable to reboot after 10 tries battery was fully charged.  Used the return Process to take it to an Amazon Return center within my local Kohls store so far no further updates and no refund has appeared yet in my gift card account after nearly a week.  My patience for the Amazon return process is running thin
Don’t Buy This it sucks,1.0,I bought this brand new not even a whole yr ago and already the charging port and the there is NO HDMI slot also it’s telling my My Chrome system is corrupted somehow and I have to HARD RESET mind You I bought a Refurbished Chromebook from Wish more than 2 yrs ago and it still works great a lil age but perfect so DONT BUY THIS also Screen has no grip so it will flop freely with movement
Stop working in less than 4 months,1.0,The screen went blank suddenly and would not work again. It was plug in with 100% full battery charged. Really disappointed with this Samsung quality.
Worth the money,4.0,"You get what you pay for.  It is worth the cost, but the screen view is poor, the keyboard is not lit, and the built-in word processor is lacking."
Best Chromebook I have Owned,5.0,"I have owned 2 prior Chromebooks. This is by far the best - faster speed, better screen, better sound and feels more solid. This forth generation model is better in every way over my previous third generation model."
Great while it lasted - a whopping 5 months,1.0,"It was fine for what I needed it for, just used it for building inventory and spreadsheets for work. One day it updated, and wasn't turning on here and there. 2nd week after update it just wouldn't turn on at all. Bought it in October and got it near the end of the month, and it died the Second week of March. So 270+ for 5 months of a laptop/chromebook only used with google sheets is extremely disappointing."
Not as good as Amazon fire,1.0,Will not connect to my wifi. I think you may as well send your money to your grandson or throw it in the wind. Total waste. From other reviews I can believe they are true. I also think it's a quality control issue. Maybe one in ten or so are like the one I have. JUNK.
expected,5.0,Its as I had expected it to be. The book is light and durable. I've dropped mine multiple times without damage. It's easy to operate with simple designed features.
Bummed!,3.0,NOT A TOUCH SCREEN AS ADVERTISED! I will be returning for that reason. The quality is decent and light weight.
"THIS DOES NOT support a stylus, as in the description when I purchased it",2.0,"It seems the description may have been updated, but when I contacted support, they directed me to buy a stylus (based on, apparently, their own reading of the description).  Of course it didn't work. This doesn't support a stylus, as I found out when I contacted support again to ask what I could possibly be doing wrong.  And, of course, I can't return it - I opened it, logged in, set it up.  Worst Amazon service ever.  I gave it 3 stars as it seems it does what it's supposed to now that the description has been updated."
Nice chromebook,4.0,"I am unable to get good access to my yahoo email account.  This is frustrating and unexpected, but all other features are great.  I would recommend this chromebook."
Great for School,5.0,"Due to covid, we were given the opportunity to buy a chromebook instead of borrowing one. This gets the job done."
Works great!,5.0,"This is a handy device to have to carry around if you need to access the internet for emails, browsing, etc.  It's small and lightweight, is quick and easy to use.  I like the quality of the build and the screen resolution is fine."
Great product,5.0,An amazing product. The only thing I didn't really like about the chrome book is the screen is a little dark
good for the price,4.0,It feels like it isn't going to fall apart on me but the screen quality could be better.  I do really love the ease of the keyboard.  I sometimes wish I could turn the volume up higher but I just put headphones on.
Can't send picture all wrapped up sorry.,1.0,IOut side it is spotless I cant tell you anything about inside. Have small problems until yesterday today I have had iti am done .between the computer and my brother passing away and my cancer(Vietnam veteran) thangs for your text.
Great other than the screen quality,4.0,This chromebook is the perfect size for me and has a really long battery life.  The only thing I don't like is that the screen isn't as sharp as I expected. That was disappointing coming from Samsung whose other products I've been extremely happy with.
8 year old birthday!!,5.0,I bought this for 8 year old Granddaughter. Perfect starter computer. Her dad had a friend to add extra protection for her online time. She will get to use it for school and she has Kid Messager so she can call me!
Stopped working and lost operating system,1.0,"I hardly had it a month and it stopped working completely.  Said it didn’t have an operating system at all and I needed to download one.  What?  This is horrible.  And it didn’t happen until past thirty days from purchase.  I bought it for my daughter’s birthday, so we didn’t use it until recently."
Not what I expected,2.0,"Couldn't connect to my Canon wireless printer without jumping thru hoops. Very selective with what apps it will download. Just not worth it. Getting tablet that is lighter, touch screen and more usable"
Packing process needs to be more thorough.,4.0,"Everything was delivered as advertised. The Chromebook works perfectly. However, the packaging left a lot to be desired. The compartment of the shipping box where the Chromebook was had a lot of extra space and the Chromebook slid around whenever the box was moved. There was no padding to protect the Chromebook during shipping. So many things could have damaged it while it was in transit. Fortunately, we got lucky and it arrived intact."
Calidad/ precio,4.0,"Mi especialista técnico dice que casi no tiene capacidad, ( no se les puede instalar programas pesados )sirve para que los niños tomen las clases por internet, para eso se compro. Calidad/ precio acorde."
This computer is a complete waste of money.,1.0,"WARNING!!! DO NOT  BUY THIS  PIECE OF JUNK!!! I simply turned on my computer one day out of warranty and saw a bunch of lines criss crossing the screen. The folks at Samsung decided it was damaged somehow by me.I swear on a stack of bibles that my computer was never dropped, had anything spilled on it or dropped anything on the top or bottom.Since my husband and I  live alone I guess we had a little elf living under the bed who wrecked my computer. Don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk. I sure wish I  hadn't."
Screen is awful at any angle,2.0,"As others have said, the screen sucks if looking at it even slightly off center."
Works Well,5.0,"Got this for my grandson, for third grade Distance Learning.  My son reported that it works very well and my grandson  is greatly enjoying it.  Note that it does NOT have a touch screen."
"Good Chromebook, mediocre display",4.0,"We bought two of these for homeschooling. The displays, as other reviews have said, are the worst thing about them. Wouldn't want to sit in front of one all day, but that's not how we use them. For having our kids do their Time4Learning lessons, they're fine. At this price point we've been very happy."
Great Device,5.0,"Even though it's small I love its performance and the availability of apps,  it's like a larger version of my phone and it's compatible with my Samsung Galaxy Smartphone. My suggestion is that you use a mouse with it instead of the mousepad it comes with."
Not completely satisfied,3.0,I would give 5 stars if it had one more USB port like the older version so I can charge my phone and still have a wireless mouse hooked up to it
Much better than other reviews I read,4.0,Biggest negative of the reviews I read was the display.  I have found the display to be more than acceptable.  This is a very nice Chromebook for the price.  I have no complaints.
Basic,4.0,"This Chromebook is for basic use, hence, why it’s so cheap. I bought it as a gift for someone and fortunately I know enough about computers to help them with the setup since it did not come with Chrome OS installed. Overall good buy. The screen isn’t the best but it does the job."
Mom was happy,5.0,Got this for my mother who is not tech savvy at all and she seems to be able to navigate through it fairly easily and she was really excited that I replaced her laptop of about 1 million years with this.
A great gift!,5.0,"I gifted this to my daughter, who needed something to use for internet accounts and surfing.  This was perfect and she is able to access things that she wasn't able to on her tablet."
Taotally Failed After 7 Months,1.0,My grandaughter was using the computer for her virtual schooling. It was great for the first 7 monthsand then today whil taking a break when she tried to log on there was no screen. It had power but the power button would not do anything. the blue power light was lit but nothing. absolutely nothin on the laptop. Have to buy a new on. It won't be this one.
Okay.,4.0,"This for the size really, really needs a touch screen.  It does have a USB A port, which was a pleasant surprise. Just received recently, so I'll update as time warrants."
Chromebook is my laptop of choice!,5.0,I like Samsung products and appreciate their craftsmanship. The Chromebook is easy to use. I like how it combines the best features of a pc and a Kindle. I chose wisely!
It works fine for its price but it does feel cheap,4.0,I was worried about screen quality based on other reviews but I haven't seen any specific issue.  It is fine for the price I paid for it but it still feels very cheap
Spec's and Processor Speed !,4.0,"I purchased , this Computer for my neices who's starting her 2 semester of College !  I didn't not test or play with this computer myself ! I "" hope it works ❤️‍🩹"
very poor image quality ... the materials are of poor quality.  If I could I would return it.,2.0,very poor image quality ... the materials are of poor quality.  If I could I would return it.
I love It!!,5.0,This is the best chromebook! So simple to use! It does everything I need to do. No windows to bother with!!! I definetely would buy this again!!! Great size too!! Very fast!
Very well built and user friendly,5.0,"I purchased for my mother who isn't great with electronics and computers. It's easy to use, very user friendly for someone just wanting to go on the internet. We've had one prior to this that was great easy to use to."
"lost in shipping, replaced quickly",4.0,"The original computer was lost in shipping. Amazon had us wait a few more days but then replaced the item quickly.  So far, very satisfied. this is the right purchase for my 4th grader"
Good computer for a novice computer user.,4.0,"I bought this computer for my mom, and it's been working well for her. It's simple and easy to use. The screen is rather small and difficult to see though. It's fuzzy, in a way. Not the best screen."
Very nice chrome book,4.0,Very nice little chrome book everything works as described and only $200 when I purchased. Only complaint is windows on it was already expired when I received it.
Look for something else.,2.0,Screen quality makes you feel like what I feel cataracts would be like.Battery life is great.
Ok,3.0,I'm a bit disappointed. The chromebook have two cracks/scrapes on it. The device overall is working but I'm a bit disappointed by those 2 ugly marks
Good buy - NOT a touch screen!,5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter birthday, she love it. Even though it is NOT a touch screen this laptop is a good buy."
"Simple, quick, perfect!",5.0,"LOVE how fast this is compared to my older Samsung laptop. Does all I need with ease! Slight learning curve for me on the TouchPad, but overall I give this overall 5 stars. Screen is a little difficult to see clearly from all angles (to be expected). Great price, shipped quickly, still a Samsung fangirl after all 😉"
Not as described,1.0,"Item was not as described, several issues straight from the start. Listed as new, but was not, even after resetting, could not fix issues/wipe content from previous user, and several key settings/functions were inaccessable and/or disabled. Isn't worth the hassle to go through the return process, but wanted to make sure that others were aware of potential issues. Would not recommend this product."
Best bang for buck,5.0,I got the cheapest one.  Works great.  Screen is great.  Not sure what all the bad screen reviews are alluding to.  Would i buy it again?  In a heart beat.
It just dies,5.0,My son used this product about five times only for virtual school and it has just died. No downloads nothing. This thing is garbage.
"Ok, It works with Linux after enabling developer mode",3.0,So I had some difficulty getting Linux turned on ( enabled ) but did muddle through eventually. so it is working for me just fine
"Lightweight, but worth every penny",5.0,"I am using this product as a replacement of my older HP laptop. First off. Let me say, I love how light this is on my wrists. And how comfortable it is to use. So glad I made this purchase.If I can, I'll update with pictures!"
Do not buy this computer ',1.0,This item is not a touchscreen it is poor and service and  is only for anyone who is interested in writing a book please do not purchase this item it is not worth the price that you pay for it the screen is small the letters do not light up it's a piece of s*** you try to login you have to do like five to eight times before you can actually get into the system do not buy this item it is crap again I say do not buy this item it is crap
Fast enough for my needs,5.0,Replaced a Asus C213S. Miss the extra USB C charge port and Touch screen but like this Samsung better otherwise.
OK chromebook,4.0,"Just a little too small for me, bought it for someone else and the type is hard to set to a readable size."
display resolution and viewing angle are bad,3.0,I bought it as a streaming device and for news watching. The processor speed seems to do good.Unfortunately the screen resolution is not high and the the angle to look at the screen is highly limited.
Battery stopped holding charge after 3 months,1.0,I bought this product new only three months ago and the battery has already stopped charging. Previous models took two years to develop that problem.
Not so great buy,2.0,Bought his recently for distance learning and has not been working out too well.  Zoom sessions are gargled no matter where we have connected the laptop.
"Great computer, bad product purchase description",4.0,"Only thing I'm disappointed about is the lack of upfront clarity about it not being a touch screen.It's small and compact and is king of battery life, I've had it for about a month use it excessively for school in the evening and I've only charged it twice. Neither time it really needed it."
Good battery life but trackpad and power buttons not sensitive,5.0,"I only charged it for 3h when I first received it, and it had lasted for around 11h! The trackpad is not sensitive, so I will recommend users to use mouse instead. power on/off button is not sensitive as well. Better to keep it locked and hibernated instead."
Great laptop,5.0,I am extremely happy with this laptop.  My grandson uses it for virtual school and it is perfect for that.
Great buy,5.0,Great exactly what children need for remote school small sleek easy yo carry great price great quality
Giant smart phone.,1.0,"I wanted a new computer. I thought the chromebook would be just the thing. Little did I know this was a giant smart phone. When I saved stuff, POOF, disappears, and can't find my files. Tree filestructure is non-existent, so you can't save where you can find it again."
"The difference between Chromebook and a ""regular notebook",3.0,I didn't know rhe difference between chromebook and Windows.  Wish I'd known...prefer Windows because I m Moore familiar with it.
Works as described,5.0,got it on a sale for ~$160...great value for money.  most of our life is internet-based these days.
No touch screen,3.0,", we didn't realize it did not have touch screen. Will add to review once it actually gets used."
So Disappointed in this Purchase,1.0,HDMI port doesn’t work. So disappointed. Only reason I got it was to mirror to TV. I never would have bought this had I known it wasn’t capable of the one feature I needed it for.

Waste of Money,3.0,I bought this laptop because it was cheap and I didn't know how bad Chrome OS was. There is almost nothing I can do but web surfing. Nothing's compatible.. Don't use Google products. You become a tester.

Good,5.0,Good all good
order this only if u need mimimal production,1.0,this laptop sucks
Easy to work on,4.0,Light weight
Good product for the money,5.0,Overall great product.. take the screen reviews with a grain of salt.. your buying a chromebook not a gaming lap.. purchased the 6gb version and have had no issues.. it functions perfectly for its intended purpose.
Great deal,4.0,Great deal for the price.  I use it for travel and use a PixelBook for home.  As others have said the screen could be better.  If the angle is right it is very usable but fades quickly if viewed from the sides.  Linux apps run great (I use Moneydance and libreodfice).  For Android apps you'll probably miss the fact that this model does not have a touchscreen and some Android games require it.  I would have given 5 stars if the screen was better.
A Chromebook replacing my Win10 Laptop? Yup!,5.0,"I fell into this Chromebook purely by accident. My mother received a free CB 3 from Verizon which she gave to me not long afterwards. I was going to sell it, got to tinkering with it and liked it so much I bought this CB4 with 64GB of flash memory and 6GB of RAM. The Chromebook is no longer ""snappy"". It's now proper quick when used as it is intended. This lightweight little CB is replacing my 15.6 Asus I7 laptop as my go to for home and the office. I can take it anywhere and it fits in the top case on my motorcycle, a huge deal for me. I would say the screen is not great and even at this price point, it should be better. The resolution is fine; trying to find the sweet spot for viewing is not. The plastic scratches way too easily and that bothers me more than anything else. I also wish it had at least one more USB-C port and would even have settle for a USB-A 3.0. But with a battery life that lasts in double digits (I can use it all day at work and when I get home without recharging), the perfect size and performance that makes it a viable work laptop, this Chromebook 4 is highly recommended."
Great if you can get it on sale,4.0,"I'll start by saying that I purchased this from another site where it was on sale, so I only paid a bit over $170 for a brand-new Samsung Chromebook 4. Additionally, people should keep in mind that this is a chromebook running Chrome OS, not a Windows PC with Windows 10; comparing this to the latter is pointless, and people who complain that it doesn't work like a $1,000 device with a more robust operating system clearly didn't do their homework and/or have unreasonable expectations.The battery life is great, and I can easily get over twelve hours of use out of it. It's also extremely lightweight, and is roughly the size of a spiral-bound notebook, so it's highly portable. Additionally, it's very fast--it boots up in less that five seconds, apps open basically instantaneously, and searches are executed right away. It has two USB ports, including a USB-C port, the latter of which is also used to connect the charger. The casing is also very nice, and it doesn't feel overly cheap and plastic-y like many chromebooks do. Installing Android apps and getting the Linux terminal running was very easy. Additionally, I'd honestly say that Chrome OS probably has the most user-friendly desktop UI, which, when combined with its security features, makes this a great option for kids or elderly people, as well as people who just need a device to browse the internet on or who (like me) wanted a backup device to take with them when they travel.The only reason I don't give this 5 stars--frankly, I'd rather only deduct half of one, but the review system won't let me--is because the screen is quite bad. It's probably the worst quality screen on any device I own, and I have a $60 smartphone (as a backup device to my ""real"" phone, but still). If you look at it at even a slight angle, it becomes borderline unviewable. Additionally, it looks almost as if there are some sort of spaces between all of the pixels; this is especially noticeable on light-colored screens. It's still usable, but is nonetheless disappointing.Overall, I'm quite happy with this, although I'd certainly be less so if I had paid full price due to the screen. That being said, this is absolutely worth considering if you're looking for a budget chromebook, especially if you can get it for cheap and/or screen quality isn't that important to you."
My school purchased hundreds of these. I don't recommend them.,2.0,"We have distributed hundreds of these Chromebooks to our kids. We also purchased hundreds of Dell 3100 Chromebooks. We have had ten times as many issues with the Samsung Chromebooks (power/charging problems, trackpad issues, broken screens, connection problems, etc).  If you have a choice, choose a Dell."
Great Laptop!,5.0,"This is a great laptop, especially for the value! I originally ordered 2 Samsung chrome book 3 11.6' for homeschooling our children.  The sellers, Newhope Dreams, contacted me to let me know that they had a better version and I would be getting a free upgrade for 2 Samsung chrome book 4 11.6' with more memory and a faster processor.  The laptops were extremely easy to set up and get started, like 20 minutes tops!  My children are comfortable using them and are adjusting to homeschooling very well.  It is fast, offers google play store and they love it.  We are beyond pleased and would recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for an easy transition.  Thank you Newhope Dreams!"
A Big Disappointment!,2.0,"I have owned about six different samsung chromebooks, and have generally been happywith them.....I cannot say the same for this model.Seems very heavy and clunky compared to others, and the screen is horrible.The hinges are so cheap looking also.  Skip this model!"
Gets the job done even with an eye sore of a screen,3.0,"Its cute. Its light and built little above average. Keyboard is just ok with its little unique twist on keyboard layout. Battery life has changed when later updates came, it doesn't last as long. The screen...like many have rated a low score on is a kick to the teeth. Its not all that bright, the angles wash out whats being displayed, and well a plus is that its anti-glare. I mean you can only get so much for a chromebook that's priced for a few hundred dollars."
Bleh,1.0,Very poor performance. I bought 4 of these it is impossible to get 1 of them to download anything.  Very good internet as I Hotspot connected it from my Google Fi phone.
Great purchase,5.0,Love how light it is and how easy it is to use. Great purchase
I'm happy with it.,5.0,I had the last one and this one is awesome. Great deal for the money. Will buy again.
"small, what I need, always ready",5.0,"this is a super convenient do-just-about-everything-personal-related computer. I don't need real spreadsheets or non Google stuff to make my personal life work, so this small machine is great. Super good price, plug&play and so easy to manage. Long battery too. Love it for my personal life."
Warning!!,1.0,"Have had it less than a year, bought it July 2020 it is March 2021 and it has glitched twice, the second time not allowing me to log into my main profile on the computer at all. Return window and support for it has closed. I suggest buying things like this from an actual store that offer extended warranty."
Tomorrow’s technology today,5.0,This chrome book is today’s technology.  Built road tough and can do so much. This is the way to go!!!!
Nice small computer.,4.0,Basically a Google tablet in laptop form. Had to return because I needed windowa 10.

Perfection,5.0,It was great I love it
Samsung Chromebook Fan,5.0,"A few years ago I bought a chromebook 3 and it still works fine, but the family needed a second one. Saw this updated version and decided to give it a chance. Amazon packed the box it came it very well with the bubble wrap plus the socks I had ordered too... well done Amazon.... hahaha.I've been using this for a few hours and so far I had a zoom meeting, checked my mail, personalized some settings and cleared up a few apps that were nice but I personally didn't need.Pros: The smaller size. It's not heavy on my lap. Easily fit in any backpack.Keyboard is as smooth as butter, or creamy peanut butter, depending on whether you know how to really type.Hasn't gotten hot... been using it for a few hours and it's barely warn (then again I am in an air conditioned room).I like the screen. To me, who has to wear glasses, it's ok. Don't see too much of a difference from my chromebook 3. Edit: I do wish I could control the contrast while watching tv shows on some websites.Some have complained about having to view it from a ""sweet spot"". Please realize that many use these small laptops outside the home. Making a sideways view difficult means that some stranger sitting nearby will have trouble seeing your screen. It's sort of a subtle safety feature I learned about many moons ago.Cons: The charging cable is a little too short for where I want to plug in. I got a good extension cord for it.Only one usb port. I don't use it too much but it's nice to have more than one just in case one damaged.A small Con: Speakers could be better. They are underneath the laptop but I usually use headphones anyway. And I have a small bluetooth speaker I can plug in that I can use sometimes.Other stuff: There is a Night light feature that I have not really tested yet since I don't use the computer with the lights out. It gives the screen an orange/yellow tint. Edit: I'm using that now and it's means less eye strain.And I wish it came in other colors but hey, as long as I can get online I'm content.Update Nov 2021: Got a 4th one for an elderly relative. They like checking the news and watching youtube mostly but the tablet they had was really old so surprised them with this. The touchpad is a tiny bit loose but it clicks well. Got this on sale and very happy with the laptop."
Was NOT what I expected.,2.0,Very BASIC computer! Got for my son who mainly loves gaming.. this is not computer for that! Could not download any apps for Roblox.. etc. very basic.
