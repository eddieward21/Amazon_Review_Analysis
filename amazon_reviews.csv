excellent machine with unacceptable screen,2.0,"About Me/ExpectationsI purchased this chromebook after having a wonderful experience with the Samsung Chromebook 3. I was very excited about the prospect of an updated version of the chromebook and when I saw that it had 6 GB of ram—I had high hopes of this being the perfect compromise between its shortcomings (aesthetics and screen size) to gain the advantages that I wanted (speed and weight). I am a college professor who uses the chromebook as a secondary machine to browse the web, manage emails, and watch videos on Youtube. While I do these things I also use a small combination of android productivity apps, either Pandora or Spotify playing in the background, and 8-12 tabs open at once. In the spectrum of chrome users, I believe I am representative of the basic or moderate level consumer. I am familiar with the operating system and have fair expectations of what a chromebook can and can’t do, but I am not a power user and do not push the system with external monitors, complicated apps, or use linux.Pros1. Speed: This chromebook utilizes the Celeron N4000 processor and 6 gb of ram. I really think that anyone who hasn’t had a chromebook or hasn’t updated in a while will be happy if they find a machine that uses the N4000 processor. Although it is only a dual-core Celeron processor that doesn’t wow you with its base speed, it has a 4 mb cache. Most of the processors in budget machines in the past generations had 1-2 mb caches at most. This change is one that you actually feel when using the chromebook because this will increase the pace of things I believe most users like such as: switching between tabs, quickly loading pages, and multitasking. The 6 gb of ram is a unique selling point and a really excellent choice by Samsung. Chromebooks usually come in two ram options 4 gb vs. 8 gb with the 8 gb units typically much rarer and unavailable as an upgrade on many units. While they run perfectly well on 4 gb, the 6 gb is a comfortable upgrade. It is impossible for me to isolate how much of the buttery smooth speed of the machine is due to the processor or due to the extra 2 gb of ram from the norm, but the combination makes for a wonderful user experience.2. Size: The weight of the machine and the form factor are very satisfying. This device adds very little weight to your bag while traveling and for walks across campus, that lighter frame is much appreciated. I enjoy the fact that despite being so light that it does not feel overly cheap; it’s far sturdier than one would expect for a cheap and light device. Overall, for anyone who enjoys the lightweight portability provided by an 11.6 inch machine—this one fits the bill while feeling substantial enough that it avoids feeling flimsy.Con:Screen: This is the first time that I can say that on a machine that I otherwise enjoyed that there was a single feature that could be a deal-breaker, but the screen is genuinely that bad. It isn’t because of the resolution because most chromebooks, especially in the budget range and at 11.6 inch screen size, all have the same resolution. It also isn’t because it is a TN panel because the Samsung Chromebook 3 had a manageable TN panel that didn’t break its usability. This panel is just wretched. It has ridiculously specific viewing angles. If you don’t hit it spot on with your eyes then colors wash out and text gets blurry at the top or bottom of the screen. It’s so grainy, washed out, and pixelated that it unfits the device for almost all of my primary needs. The brightness even seems less than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I am just flabbergasted that they selected such a bad panel that feels like a step back from their best-selling previous model. The screen was literally so bad I wondered if I had a defective model, but my experience seems consistent with the limited reviews available for this machine.ConclusionThis machine was one that I wanted to love and everything that I saw on paper that I believed I would like—I did. The speed is there and the 6 gb of ram cannot be undersold as an excellent choice by Samsung, so I was happy about that. The keyboard was serviceable, which I expected and would have been satisfied with if it hadn’t been for the screen. The screen is just unacceptable at any price point. The speed and smooth operation cannot offset the quality of the panel being used here. You look at the screen for everything you do unless you are using an external monitor and this one is almost guaranteed to give you eyestrain and become an irritating chore to constantly rework the angle of your eyes to the screen and the angle of the screen on the hinge. In my opinion it just isn’t worth it. This might sound like I am overly critical or I am knocking the machine too much for one issue, but an otherwise spectacular experience can, indeed, be ruined if one of the key components used is as bad as this screen. Showroom this model against alternative 11.6 inch chromebooks and you will see what I mean. Don’t select nicer models, IPS screens, or more expensive models; put it side-by-side with other budget TN options and you will see that at the same resolution and same size that the numbers lie and this screen is simply worse than the alternatives. Despite my desire to love it and the excellent choices made my Samsung for the processor and ram combo, the screen panel choice outweighs those good choices and destroys the quality of the final product."
Poor screen quality,2.0,I bought the 6 GB ram model directly from Samsung.  If the screen was better this would be five stars.  Good build quality and the little details seemed to be well done.  The screen though makes this useless.  The screen is highly directional.  Slight movement causes the screen to changebrightnesss level to such a degree that it results in eye strain.  This happened with just the slight movement from resting it on my lap and trying to work on it.  Even when viewed from the best angle the text appears fuzzy and shadowed.  The screen quality is unfortunate since this would be a fantastic unit otherwise.
Product good - service not so much,4.0,"This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!"
Love this thing,5.0,"Listen, this is a sub $300 Chromebook— they had to cut costs somewhere. Is the TN panel great? No. But this laptop cost me $302 with tax, has 6gb of RAM and 64gb of storage, will be updated at least until 2026,  also does what I need it to do (homework/writing). I have the Samsung Chrome book 3 too, and the 4 is a nice upgrade. This is a light laptop with a small footprint. so I can easily carry it back and forth to campus. Also, the new design is freaking sexy. Probably my favorite laptop of all time."
Great Chromebook,4.0,"This is a great Chromebook with good keyboard, touchpad, and great battery life. The display is not as good as those laptops costing 2 to 4 times as much but it is fine for daily use and I don't find it be a problem even when using it for long periods of time."
Great Internet machine,4.0,"I ordered this for my wife. It is perfect for her to surf the Internet and check email quickly. As others have said, the screen could be better. The screen is not good when viewed at from an angle. But then, it's an inexpensive item. It's the first Chromebook I've ever purchased. The speed is great. It boots almost instantly. It has great battery life. It is very light. The keyboard is responsive. It has to USB 3.0 ports and bluetooth. I connected an inexpensive bluetooth mouse to the system without a problem. My wife could not be happier."
Poor quality,3.0,Pixels went out after less than 6 months.
Very unhappy and disappointed.,1.0,This product worked the first day for 15 min.  We charged it over night.  It now turns on for 1 sec. and then turns off immediately!  I am so upset.  This was a gift for my son so that he could do schoolwork on it.  What a waste of money.  I am trying to return it and there is no way to do it
Excellent laptop for under $300,5.0,"I am writing this based on the fact that this cost $234.  I see many reviews here complaining about the screen.  Remember what you have purchased.  This laptop is fast, light and well made.  There is even a good amount of storage for a personal computer.  Yes, the screen is not as vivid as a $1000 computer, if that is very important to you, buy a more expensive laptop.  For those who need to use email, browse the web, stream etc. you can not go wrong with this.  There is one USB port and one USB C port.  There are inexpensive attachments if you need hdmi or more ports.  I highly recommend this chromebook."
Great Product!,3.0,"I was absolutely delighted when I received this product. I originally bought it to replace my lenovo laptop that I mistakenly broke. I am a college student, so I wanted a product that could handle loading files and was light weight, making it easier to carry around campus. It came in a day early, and was much tinier then expected, which I am delighted about. Its super lightweight and seems to be running everything just fine. I will update if anything happens.***UPDATE***Okay, so at first I gave this chromebook a 5/5 star rating. However, after a few weeks of using it I have discovered some quirks about the chromebook that I find to be rather irritating as I am a creature of habit. The first one being, there is NO delete button. I don't think this would be a deal breaker at first, but it is slightly annoying. The second one being, whenever I want to write an email, I can't press ""tab"" to indent anymore.  In fact, it seems like I can't do it in any box that I can put text in, such as the box for this review. The third thing, being that you can NOT right click without pressing the ""alt"" tab. Last but not least, there is no way to add apps to the background of this device. The shortcuts are the only way to have apps available. While I understand this isn't necessarily a laptop and that features guaranteed to be different, all four of these issues combined has caused enough irritation for me to write this review. Don't get me wrong, this laptop is great for school. The web camera is wonderful, I don't have any connection issues, but these weird perks are very annoying. Had I known that the chromebooks were designed like that, it would have eased my frustrations getting use to this, or I would have considered getting something else."
