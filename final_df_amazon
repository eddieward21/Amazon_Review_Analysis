excellent machine with unacceptable screen,2.0,"About Me/ExpectationsI purchased this chromebook after having a wonderful experience with the Samsung Chromebook 3. I was very excited about the prospect of an updated version of the chromebook and when I saw that it had 6 GB of ram—I had high hopes of this being the perfect compromise between its shortcomings (aesthetics and screen size) to gain the advantages that I wanted (speed and weight). I am a college professor who uses the chromebook as a secondary machine to browse the web, manage emails, and watch videos on Youtube. While I do these things I also use a small combination of android productivity apps, either Pandora or Spotify playing in the background, and 8-12 tabs open at once. In the spectrum of chrome users, I believe I am representative of the basic or moderate level consumer. I am familiar with the operating system and have fair expectations of what a chromebook can and can’t do, but I am not a power user and do not push the system with external monitors, complicated apps, or use linux.Pros1. Speed: This chromebook utilizes the Celeron N4000 processor and 6 gb of ram. I really think that anyone who hasn’t had a chromebook or hasn’t updated in a while will be happy if they find a machine that uses the N4000 processor. Although it is only a dual-core Celeron processor that doesn’t wow you with its base speed, it has a 4 mb cache. Most of the processors in budget machines in the past generations had 1-2 mb caches at most. This change is one that you actually feel when using the chromebook because this will increase the pace of things I believe most users like such as: switching between tabs, quickly loading pages, and multitasking. The 6 gb of ram is a unique selling point and a really excellent choice by Samsung. Chromebooks usually come in two ram options 4 gb vs. 8 gb with the 8 gb units typically much rarer and unavailable as an upgrade on many units. While they run perfectly well on 4 gb, the 6 gb is a comfortable upgrade. It is impossible for me to isolate how much of the buttery smooth speed of the machine is due to the processor or due to the extra 2 gb of ram from the norm, but the combination makes for a wonderful user experience.2. Size: The weight of the machine and the form factor are very satisfying. This device adds very little weight to your bag while traveling and for walks across campus, that lighter frame is much appreciated. I enjoy the fact that despite being so light that it does not feel overly cheap; it’s far sturdier than one would expect for a cheap and light device. Overall, for anyone who enjoys the lightweight portability provided by an 11.6 inch machine—this one fits the bill while feeling substantial enough that it avoids feeling flimsy.Con:Screen: This is the first time that I can say that on a machine that I otherwise enjoyed that there was a single feature that could be a deal-breaker, but the screen is genuinely that bad. It isn’t because of the resolution because most chromebooks, especially in the budget range and at 11.6 inch screen size, all have the same resolution. It also isn’t because it is a TN panel because the Samsung Chromebook 3 had a manageable TN panel that didn’t break its usability. This panel is just wretched. It has ridiculously specific viewing angles. If you don’t hit it spot on with your eyes then colors wash out and text gets blurry at the top or bottom of the screen. It’s so grainy, washed out, and pixelated that it unfits the device for almost all of my primary needs. The brightness even seems less than the Samsung Chromebook 3. I am just flabbergasted that they selected such a bad panel that feels like a step back from their best-selling previous model. The screen was literally so bad I wondered if I had a defective model, but my experience seems consistent with the limited reviews available for this machine.ConclusionThis machine was one that I wanted to love and everything that I saw on paper that I believed I would like—I did. The speed is there and the 6 gb of ram cannot be undersold as an excellent choice by Samsung, so I was happy about that. The keyboard was serviceable, which I expected and would have been satisfied with if it hadn’t been for the screen. The screen is just unacceptable at any price point. The speed and smooth operation cannot offset the quality of the panel being used here. You look at the screen for everything you do unless you are using an external monitor and this one is almost guaranteed to give you eyestrain and become an irritating chore to constantly rework the angle of your eyes to the screen and the angle of the screen on the hinge. In my opinion it just isn’t worth it. This might sound like I am overly critical or I am knocking the machine too much for one issue, but an otherwise spectacular experience can, indeed, be ruined if one of the key components used is as bad as this screen. Showroom this model against alternative 11.6 inch chromebooks and you will see what I mean. Don’t select nicer models, IPS screens, or more expensive models; put it side-by-side with other budget TN options and you will see that at the same resolution and same size that the numbers lie and this screen is simply worse than the alternatives. Despite my desire to love it and the excellent choices made my Samsung for the processor and ram combo, the screen panel choice outweighs those good choices and destroys the quality of the final product.",5427,970,0.16954931972789125,0.5748171768707484
Poor screen quality,2.0,I bought the 6 GB ram model directly from Samsung.  If the screen was better this would be five stars.  Good build quality and the little details seemed to be well done.  The screen though makes this useless.  The screen is highly directional.  Slight movement causes the screen to changebrightnesss level to such a degree that it results in eye strain.  This happened with just the slight movement from resting it on my lap and trying to work on it.  Even when viewed from the best angle the text appears fuzzy and shadowed.  The screen quality is unfortunate since this would be a fantastic unit otherwise.,608,106,0.12174242424242422,0.47939393939393943
Product good - service not so much,4.0,"This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The ""supervisor"" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!",1241,238,0.18224789915966388,0.5641923436041083
Love this thing,5.0,"Listen, this is a sub $300 Chromebook— they had to cut costs somewhere. Is the TN panel great? No. But this laptop cost me $302 with tax, has 6gb of RAM and 64gb of storage, will be updated at least until 2026,  also does what I need it to do (homework/writing). I have the Samsung Chrome book 3 too, and the 4 is a nice upgrade. This is a light laptop with a small footprint. so I can easily carry it back and forth to campus. Also, the new design is freaking sexy. Probably my favorite laptop of all time.",507,100,0.281969696969697,0.6537878787878787
Great Chromebook,4.0,"This is a great Chromebook with good keyboard, touchpad, and great battery life.

Great Internet machine,4.0,"I ordered this for my wife. It is perfect for her to surf the Internet and check email quickly. As others have said, the screen could be better. The screen is not good when viewed at from an angle. But then, it's an inexpensive item. It's the first Chromebook I've ever purchased. The speed is great. It boots almost instantly. It has great battery life. It is very light. The keyboard is responsive. It has to USB 3.0 ports and bluetooth. I connected an inexpensive bluetooth mouse to the system without a problem.

Very unhappy and disappointed.,1.0,This product worked the first day for 15 min.  We charged it over night.  It now turns on for 1 sec. and then turns off immediately!  I am so upset.

Excellent laptop for under $300,5.0,"I am writing this based on the fact that this cost $234.  I see many reviews here complaining about the screen.  Remember what you have purchased.  This laptop is fast, light and well made.  There is even a good amount of storage for a personal computer.  Yes, the screen is not as vivid as a $1000 computer, if that is very important to you, buy a more expensive laptop.  For those who need to use email, browse the web, stream etc. you can not go wrong with this.  There is one USB port and one USB C port.  There are inexpensive attachments if you need hdmi or more ports.  I highly recommend this chromebook.",612,114,0.14850000000000002,0.659
Great Product!,3.0,"I was absolutely delighted when I received this product. I originally bought it to replace my lenovo laptop that I mistakenly broke. I am a college student, so I wanted a product that could handle loading files and was light weight, making it easier to carry around campus. It came in a day early, and was much tinier then expected, which I am delighted about. Its super lightweight and seems to be running everything just fine. I will update if anything happens.***UPDATE***Okay, so at first I gave this chromebook a 5/5 star rating. However, after a few weeks of using it I have discovered some quirks about the chromebook that I find to be rather irritating as I am a creature of habit. The first one being, there is NO delete button. I don't think this would be a deal breaker at first, but it is slightly annoying. The second one being, whenever I want to write an email, I can't press ""tab"" to indent anymore.  In fact, it seems like I can't do it in any box that I can put text in, such as the box for this review. The third thing, being that you can NOT right click without pressing the ""alt"" tab. Last but not least, there is no way to add apps to the background of this device. The shortcuts are the only way to have apps available. While I understand this isn't necessarily a laptop and that features guaranteed to be different, all four of these issues combined has caused enough irritation for me to write this review. Don't get me wrong, this laptop is great for school. The web camera is wonderful, I don't have any connection issues, but these weird perks are very annoying. Had I known that the chromebooks were designed like that, it would have eased my frustrations getting use to this, or I would have considered getting something else.",1756,320,0.10931122448979592,0.559608843537415
"If poor saturation matters, consider Grayscale",5.0,"You will get what you pay for, but not in my case as long as performance & battery life concerned. If it comes with an IPS or OLED instead of a low-end TN screen, it wouldn't be an affordable one.A TN LCD panel has a narrow viewing angle, however, it features a much faster response time than the IPS counterpart, so a gamer's choice nowadays. FYI, WebGL Aquarium test scores amazing 60 fps with 500 fishes running on this Chromebook.The poor saturation is not so terrible but barely acceptable. If that matters, a less distracting grayscale over an addictive color display would be desirable. Unfortunately, a google system-wide grayscale option is not available yet, but as a workaround, a chrome web browser addon like ""Grayscale the Web"" does a great job.I appreciate they have tried to meet the least common multiple requirements with minimalism in mind.",859,146,-0.04999999999999998,0.5392857142857144
Malfunctioning key board and inept Samsung Technical Support,1.0,"I am a long time Samsung customer.  All of my family cellphones and chromebooks are Samsung.  I usually have good luck with them. My older Samsung chromebooks were a dream to use so I thought by purchasing this - it would be the same.  but right after the month I purchased from Amazon - the keyboard malfunctioned. When I type letters, I would get other letters with it.  My numbers on my keyboard no longer worked which made it difficult for me to type in my very strong password. I had to go and use the virtual keyboard to log in. I have spent 4 hours with Samsung technical service - 1 hour of waiting on the telephone that did not count with the texting support. One technical support agent said I need to get it fixed since it appeared to be a hardware issue - but Samsung website directed me to another technical support agent when I informed it I wanted to get it fixed. Same old instructions of reset and Chrome OS updates - to no avail.  I would return this but Amazon does not accept this since this is after 30 days of purchase (it is day 40) so I will have to either find a person to fix this or buy a new one.",1124,218,0.09800556586270871,0.3612090290661719

Great for kids and distance learning,5.0,"I have a ten year old In 4th who is using this for distance learning this year.

It’s a great value for the money and perfect for an elementary school student who just needs basic internet, zoom, etc.  I was worried about screen quality after reading the reviews but it’s totally fine - don’t expect the quality of an ipad, smartphone, or tv, but it is far from terrible.

It came well packaged, brand new, no problems. The only thing that bugs me is there is no numerical pad on the side like on desktop, but considering its size, I get it. The screen also could be clearer. I definitely wouldn't recommend rhis for shopping online, but for schoolwork that I need to get done, it's fantastic.",587,109,0.23713636363636365,0.7394545454545455

Amazing,5.0,"I've used Chromebooks for years and have tried many brands. Samsung is the best, hands down.Some of my favorite features are long battery life, fast charging, no fan (it doesn't get super hot), ease of use, and simplicity. You can log on to a new one with your Gmail credentials and voila, you're up and running, just as before.This new version offers some great improvements.- Better performance. No lag during Zoom calls if you're on a decent connection, for example.- Type C charger you can share with other devices like Android smartphones- More solid shell and materials overallThe camera has not improved and I think my old one has a tiny advantage here. My Zoom setup looks brighter on my previous Chromebook for example.Overall, I love this Chromebook. I have a full laptop with a Linux build to do things that aren't suited for Chromebook but this is an excellent, lightweight solution for most of what I do for work.

Great Chromebook for the less discerning,5.0,"I needed a new Chromebook, but I specifically did not want the convertible kind with a touchscreen, and I did not want to pay more for features I actively did not want.  I also wanted one with an 11"" screen that had more memory and ram than the cheapest models.  This was pretty much the only Chromebook that fit those criteria.  I saw that most everyone liked it except for the screen, and I figured I had low enough demands for screen performance that it was worth a try.  I got a great deal on the 6/64 version, and I love it.  It's fast, lightweight, good keyboard, and the screen is fine for my philistine level of pixel appreciation.  If you like to watch movies etc. on your Chromebook I'd suggest taking into account the warnings from the other fine reviewers here, but if you just want to read, write, browse, and watch YouTube videos, you'll probably be satisfied.",874,159,0.34625668449197866,0.5767379679144384

It's decent speed, but honestly I'd rather use a tablet than have this. Unless you are using it because you absolutely have to have a computer and you're straining your eyes to type a paper, look elsewhere.

Power charger is the HDMI out-put as well.,4.0,"A good little machine.  If you just want to use it to surf the internet and that sort of thing, can't beat the price.  I knew the screen wasn't going to be the best before i bought it, and in fairness the images are a little flat, but again I just use it as an internet surfer platform.  HOWEVER,..., what i wish I did know before i bought it, and would have been a reason why i WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT is the ports available.  It DOES NOT have an HDMI port, only the mini port which is how you charge it.  So i would also use my Chrome book to watch streaming on my TV, connecting it to my larger TV, to do so i had to buy an adapter to plug in a full size HDMI into the mini, but in doing so you CANNOT charge it, so if you are watching a movie, or anything you have to run off battery power, it will always have enough to get you through a movie, but the stress of watching the batter life slowly march down to zero really plays on my anxiety.  Further there is only one USB port, so if you have a cordless mouse plugged in you can't plug in any other USB, example, if you want to download from your phone you have to unplug the cordless mouse, which drives me nuts.  But do note that it has bluetooth capabilities so you can always get a blue tooth mouse to solve that problem, I'm just not tech savy enough to pull that off.  in the end the lack of a full size HDMI AND also a charger would make me buy a different machine, but i already have it, and i make it work, stress and all when running it off battery at my work station or TV.  Just something i wish i had looked into more before i bought it.  Hope that helps.  Also there isn't a 'Delete' button, why ?",1668,338,0.15333333333333335,0.4216666666666667

Seemed worth the money but major hidden costs,1.0,"Fourth Update:A brief moment of connectivity assured me: ""You're connected to a Ethernet network."" Not just getting norked out of your two hundred smackers and your valuable time. Right? Not just serving to provide a connection to someone who lacks a valid visa, Right? Now's the time to dish the real dirt on the first purchase: it burned my legs, there was some bad circuitry or programming. This device is labeled as made in VietNam but I wouldn't be sure it's even that good. The price is cheap and the build is like from Mattel but this is no toy. Buyer Beware!!!The replacement seemed new enough & didn't burn my legs or fingers but I had to return it. Along with the bargain chromebook came some dedicated representatives of the seller/manufacturer...? Who set up camp across the creek from my cabin & have been diggling with the connections for weeks. Its been a total hassle. Still I wanted to avoid the bother of returning a $200 dollar purchase & tried & tried to make it work but just like the first purchased (killswitched) there has been an administrative kaibosh on internet access at the last day to return the thing. I was one hundred percent connected yet denied internet access (see screenshot) & had to use my older chromebook to set up the return.Updates: (third review)The replacement netbook from Samsung. Could Amazon be the unwitting host of a seller of stolen or even counterfeit goods? More and more programming irregularities keep  showing up. Like the pic I'm posting now: Prompted to use Guest Mode and/or Sign In when I already AM in Guest Mode...Still I really wanted to love the netbook but closer inspection showed more and more signs of excessive factory-programmed presets and physical scuff marks, even dings in the cover that evidenced this was a used chromebook. I would still give it four stars for the moments it did work, at one point my one-bar cell connection ran an hour-long documentary on Prime Video with virtually no interruptions, BUT once I attempted to use the logged-in owner account and install ZOOM and Bitdefender the thing just DIED!!! It won't charge, it won't turn on, NOTHING!!!Thank God I'm within the 30-day return period and bought the Assurion plan, but how disappointing to have to return it, it looks like if this sort of problem continues I might be profiled as a difficult customer.The main reason I selected this 6GB RAM Samsung Chromebook: the USB charging function, and for this I'd give it ten stars if possible.Drawbacks: The hi-speed charger that came with the unit just about overheated & I had to purchase the 45w adapter and a couple C-to-USB adapters separately, but my dream of keeping my off-grid connection charged from my rinkydink solar setup has now come true!Bonus Tips from a Non-techie: I'm not a techie here so I'm just wondering if the compatability between my Samsung phone and chromebook has boosted the connectivity through the use of tethering plus bluetooth. Whether it's the faster processor or whatnot, what took hours to load a 3-minute video before now loads instantly and this has saved me the time and expense of buying a signal booster.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K8G7663/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QMSZR2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",3323,536,0.09611162646876929,0.44908524015666856

Very handy and portable; not perfect,4.0,"Pros...I travel quite a lot and was looking for a simple, lightweight chromebook to check email, browse the internet and watch movies on, on the go. This works GREAT for that and I like that the battery life is good enough that I don't need to bring my cord on a one-day trip.The cons..... As others has mentioned, if you are not at the right angle, the screen will be black while you are watching something. That's easy to remedy when sitting, watching a movie alone; but it was very annoying while doing a fitness class via Zoom or watching something with another person. Also Zoom related, I found the camera to be pretty poor, especially in lower light. Final con is that it keeps giving me a message that I have ejected the SD card when I have not.",753,140,0.10731292517006799,0.6863945578231292
Worst of Everything,2.0,This is a phone disguised as a laptop and it can't even do what a phone can do. You cannot download and install any software. Not even office programs. It allows you to use Google docs but not very well. I feel like I've been beaten back before the '80s. Like I think word perfect did a better job. It only allows you to download phone apps which aren't super compatible on a laptop. This thing is a wreck and a mess. I usually love Google products. I have a Google Pixel phone. I have Gmail. I like these things. But Chromebooks are garbage. Save yourself the hassle and buy a laptop. You don't need a laptop pretending to be a phone that can't do half the things of phone can do and none of the things a laptop can do. You'd be better off buying a keyboard and attaching it to your phone. Horrible product.,808,156,0.1657407407407407,0.512037037037037

I like it just fine for what I'm using it for but it is small,5.0,"So far so good! Firstly we completely charge things before we use them for the first time. To all who will buy this, it is on the small side and thin but it's nice. I do wish it was packaged better for shipping, it literally came in the box it's sold in with very little support from getting jarred around in that box. I do know the carriers aren't always careful with packages so better packaging and more support would be a good thing before shipping so that the computer doesn't get jarred and banged up during the shipping process. There is nothing wrong with the computer at all and it works great but in my opinion would be great for younger people because of how small it is. For what I'm using it for it's perfect but if you're wanting a bigger screen so you can see things better and bigger this one isn't for you.

Great Little Chromebook but Be Aware of Limitations,3.0,"I'll start with the Cons:Cons: If you have a community internet system at an apartment or condo that requires a password to access the system, you will not be able to get online without jumping through a lot of hoops.  You will need to use another device (smart phone or Windows device) to get the information that explains how to do so, and it is complicated.  Buying a Chromebook is  for the purpose of simplicity and you won't be able to configure your Chromebook until you get past that hurdle.  The other con is that you cannot download the latest version of the Alexa app because it is not compatible with this unit.  If your purpose is to control/configure your smart home or other Alexa connected devices, you can't do it with this particular Chromebook.  If you want to get a Windows based laptop in the same price range, it will be in ""S"" mode, which is great; however, you will need to turn off ""S"" mode to get anything from an app store that is NOT Microsoft and can only use the Edge browser, again, by turning off S mode.  There is a simple way to remove ""S"" mode (which is for security) but once you take it off, you can never put it back on. so be aware.Pros: This is a fine looking, easy to use Chromebook that works as a Chromebook should - fast and easy to understand as long as you don't have the above listed situation.  It does not have a touch screen and the screen resolution is okay for the price point.  If you need this for a home schooled student or for just a quick way to browse the internet and make online purchases, this item is worth the money.  I'm disappointed that it didn't work out for me but in some situations, it will be just fine.

Great deal,4.0,Great deal for the price.  I use it for travel and use a PixelBook for home.  As others have said the screen could be better.  If the angle is right it is very usable but fades quickly if viewed from the sides.  Linux apps run great (I use Moneydance and libreodfice).  For Android apps you'll probably miss the fact that this model does not have a touchscreen and some Android games require it.  I would have given 5 stars if the screen was better.,449,84,0.4027210884353742,0.5622448979591836
A Chromebook replacing my Win10 Laptop? Yup!,5.0,"I fell into this Chromebook purely by accident. My mother received a free CB 3 from Verizon which she gave to me not long afterwards. I was going to sell it, got to tinkering with it and liked it so much I bought this CB4 with 64GB of flash memory and 6GB of RAM. The Chromebook is no longer ""snappy"". It's now proper quick when used as it is intended. This lightweight little CB is replacing my 15.6 Asus I7 laptop as my go to for home and the office. I can take it anywhere and it fits in the top case on my motorcycle, a huge deal for me. I would say the screen is not great and even at this price point, it should be better. The resolution is fine; trying to find the sweet spot for viewing is not. The plastic scratches way too easily and that bothers me more than anything else. I also wish it had at least one more USB-C port and would even have settle for a USB-A 3.0. But with a battery life that lasts in double digits (I can use it all day at work and when I get home without recharging), the perfect size and performance that makes it a viable work laptop, this Chromebook 4 is highly recommended.",1109,219,0.29381519274376416,0.5161904761904762
Great if you can get it on sale,4.0,"I'll start by saying that I purchased this from another site where it was on sale, so I only paid a bit over $170 for a brand-new Samsung Chromebook 4. Additionally, people should keep in mind that this is a chromebook running Chrome OS, not a Windows PC with Windows 10; comparing this to the latter is pointless, and people who complain that it doesn't work like a $1,000 device with a more robust operating system clearly didn't do their homework and/or have unreasonable expectations.The battery life is great, and I can easily get over twelve hours of use out of it. It's also extremely lightweight, and is roughly the size of a spiral-bound notebook, so it's highly portable. Additionally, it's very fast--it boots up in less that five seconds, apps open basically instantaneously, and searches are executed right away. It has two USB ports, including a USB-C port, the latter of which is also used to connect the charger. The casing is also very nice, and it doesn't feel overly cheap and plastic-y like many chromebooks do. Installing Android apps and getting the Linux terminal running was very easy. Additionally, I'd honestly say that Chrome OS probably has the most user-friendly desktop UI, which, when combined with its security features, makes this a great option for kids or elderly people, as well as people who just need a device to browse the internet on or who (like me) wanted a backup device to take with them when they travel.The only reason I don't give this 5 stars--frankly, I'd rather only deduct half of one, but the review system won't let me--is because the screen is quite bad. It's probably the worst quality screen on any device I own, and I have a $60 smartphone (as a backup device to my ""real"" phone, but still). If you look at it at even a slight angle, it becomes borderline unviewable. Additionally, it looks almost as if there are some sort of spaces between all of the pixels; this is especially noticeable on light-colored screens. It's still usable, but is nonetheless disappointing.Overall, I'm quite happy with this, although I'd certainly be less so if I had paid full price due to the screen. That being said, this is absolutely worth considering if you're looking for a budget chromebook, especially if you can get it for cheap and/or screen quality isn't that important to you.",2326,402,0.14070707070707078,0.5976406926406926
My school purchased hundreds of these. I don't recommend them.,2.0,"We have distributed hundreds of these Chromebooks to our kids. We also purchased hundreds of Dell 3100 Chromebooks. We have had ten times as many issues with the Samsung Chromebooks (power/charging problems, trackpad issues, broken screens, connection problems, etc).

Great Laptop!,5.0,"This is a great laptop, especially for the value! I originally ordered 2 Samsung chrome book 3 11.6' for homeschooling our children.  The sellers, Newhope Dreams, contacted me to let me know that they had a better version and I would be getting a free upgrade for 2 Samsung chrome book 4 11.6' with more memory and a faster processor.  The laptops were extremely easy to set up and get started, like 20 minutes tops!  My children are comfortable using them and are adjusting to homeschooling very well.  It is fast, offers google play store and they love it.  We are beyond pleased and would recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for an easy transition.

A Big Disappointment!,2.0,"I have owned about six different samsung chromebooks, and have generally been happywith them.....I cannot say the same for this model.Seems very heavy and clunky compared to others, and the screen is horrible.The hinges are so cheap looking also.

Gets the job done even with an eye sore of a screen,3.0,"Its cute. Its light and built little above average. Keyboard is just ok with its little unique twist on keyboard layout. Battery life has changed when later updates came, it doesn't last as long. The screen...like many have rated a low score on is a kick to the teeth. Its not all that bright, the angles wash out whats being displayed, and well a plus is that its anti-glare. I mean you can only get so much for a chromebook that's priced for a few hundred dollars.",466,87,0.1525,0.5036111111111111

Samsung Chromebook Fan,5.0,"A few years ago I bought a chromebook 3 and it still works fine, but the family needed a second one. Saw this updated version and decided to give it a chance. Amazon packed the box it came it very well with the bubble wrap plus the socks I had ordered too... well done Amazon.... hahaha.I've been using this for a few hours and so far I had a zoom meeting, checked my mail, personalized some settings and cleared up a few apps that were nice but I personally didn't need.Pros: The smaller size. It's not heavy on my lap. Easily fit in any backpack.Keyboard is as smooth as butter, or creamy peanut butter, depending on whether you know how to really type.Hasn't gotten hot... been using it for a few hours and it's barely warn (then again I am in an air conditioned room).I like the screen. To me, who has to wear glasses, it's ok. Don't see too much of a difference from my chromebook 3. Edit: I do wish I could control the contrast while watching tv shows on some websites.Some have complained about having to view it from a ""sweet spot"". Please realize that many use these small laptops outside the home. Making a sideways view difficult means that some stranger sitting nearby will have trouble seeing your screen. It's sort of a subtle safety feature I learned about many moons ago.Cons: The charging cable is a little too short for where I want to plug in. I got a good extension cord for it.Only one usb port. I don't use it too much but it's nice to have more than one just in case one damaged.A small Con: Speakers could be better. They are underneath the laptop but I usually use headphones anyway. And I have a small bluetooth speaker I can plug in that I can use sometimes.Other stuff: There is a Night light feature that I have not really tested yet since I don't use the computer with the lights out. It gives the screen an orange/yellow tint. Edit: I'm using that now and it's means less eye strain.And I wish it came in other colors but hey, as long as I can get online I'm content.Update Nov 2021: Got a 4th one for an elderly relative. They like checking the news and watching youtube mostly but the tablet they had was really old so surprised them with this. The touchpad is a tiny bit loose but it clicks well. Got this on sale and very happy with the laptop.",2279,427,0.1203161421911422,0.48282342657342653
